# Textbook-Knowledge-Network

## Introduction

1) As the related textbook data are currently being used for subsequent doctoral research, the original textbook texts cannot be publicly shared at this time. A sample text is provided here solely to demonstrate the network construction code. The relevant original data can be obtained from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
2) The network analysis and mixed-effects model code use data derived from the PEP textbook.
3) This project contains source code and some core data for the paper titled "Decoding cross-cultural textbook networks: structural patterns, formation mechanisms, and predictive insights using a topologyâ€“cognition framework".

All the codes run perfectly on Python 3.10, and the libraries used are as follows:

* matplotlib==3.9.1
* networkx==3.3
* numpy==1.26.4
* openpyxl==3.1.4
* pandas==2.2.2

We do not guarantee normal operation on other versions.
